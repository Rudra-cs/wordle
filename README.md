# steps taken to create

-   make the readme
-   `yarn create vite reacdle --template react-ts .`
-   [add tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite)
-   did some googling and seems adding Jest to Vite isn't easy
-   so let's use [vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
-   let's start by getting our core algorithm working
    -   [found a 5 letter word list to use](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/5-letter-words.htm)
        -   hehe `copy(Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.TCont li a')).map(a => a.innerText))`
-   meh, i want to do UI first, lets switch to making the basic word guess building block
-   start making WordRow
    -   realize I need to finally learn [css grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Relationship_of_Grid_Layout)
    -   got initial basic design and then realized i needed to go back to making the core algorithm work
-   ok get `computeGuess()` working
-   realizied i forgot some edge cases of `computerGuess` and had to fix them
-   update props of WordRow and clean up styles somewhat
-   let's get our store working! adding zustand and getting the UI to work accordingly
    -   at this point i wanted to get letter input working...so i just kept coding and coding
    -   got the raw behavior working...but let's stop for now
-   want to add validation to game (only allow 6 guesses) but think it may be easier to do this with UI tests
    -   so go to [vitest examples](https://vitest.dev/guide/#examples) which leads to [their react-testing-library example](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/examples/react-testing-lib) and then cross test that it's [the same as react testing libraries setup guide](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/setup)
    -   just went down a huge rabit hole getting RTL working with vitest only to find that jest-dom TypeScript support is broken
-   more tests! getting more game functionality together
-   spend way too long to get empty state of the game to have correct default height
-   get things deployable for fun and profit
-   Refactor store to save computed guesses into store so we can calculate game state more easily
-   this took far too much time than it should have
    -   i wanted to move from input box to global keyDown listener
    -   i ran into the issue where a function handler closes over a value so the `guess` `useState` value was stale and never changed
    -   it took me far too long to think about how to deconstruct the problem and make it simpler
    -   happy with the end result but man...i wish it didn't take so long
-   some minor refactoring to get isValidWord working. had to move state around
-   add the keyboard for mobile use!
